# Research and Learning

* Modules

* Left arrow operator in GoLang

> It is used for channel operations.

> `Receive operation`: When you place the <- operator to the left of a channel, it receives a value from the channel. For example: `value := <-ch`
Here, value will be assigned the next value sent on the ch channel.

> `Send operation`: When you place the <- operator to the right of a channel, it sends a value to the channel.
For example: `ch <- value`
Here, the value of value is sent to the ch channel.

> These operations are blocking by default, meaning that a send will block until another goroutine is ready to receive from the channel, and vice versa. This feature is useful for synchronizing goroutines and passing data between them safely.

* Channel direction

How do you specify the direction of a channel type?

* Write your own Sleep function using time.After.

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func sleep(duration time.Duration) {
    <- time.After(duration)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Going to sleep...")
    sleep(3 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Not really sleeped well...")
}
```

* Go provides tools to check how much of your code is covered by tests. To generate a coverage report, run:

```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

This will generate an HTML report showing which lines of code are covered by tests.

* `Example Tests`: Example tests serve as both documentation and executable tests. They start with Example and can include output comments to verify correctness.

```go
func ExampleAdd() {
    fmt.Println(Add(1, 2))
    // Output: 3
}
```

// Output: comments are used to indicate the expected output.
// When you run go test, the framework checks if the actual output matches.

* Benchmark Tests
Go allows you to write benchmarks to measure the performance of your code.
Benchmark functions start with Benchmark and have the signature func BenchmarkXxx(b *testing.B).

Example:

```go
func BenchmarkAdd(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        Add(1, 2)
    }
}```

`b.N`: Represents the number of iterations the benchmark will run.
It is automatically managed by the testing framework.
